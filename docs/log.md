# Knowledge base update log

## 2026-10-09
* globu-status: Update knowledge turns the band into Updating knowledge... at once, nothing counts during the update and the band clears when its turn ends.
* Switched the marketplace entries to the full HTTPS URL of the repo, because Claude Code clones the owner/repo shorthand of a git-subdir source over SSH only. Noted why in [architecture](./architecture.md).

## 2026-10-08
* Added `globu resolve`, which checks that references exist on the default branch of their repo, and the `check-issue` skill, which extracts references from a Jira issue and calls it. Documented both in [globu CLI](./globu-cli.md) and [architecture](./architecture.md) and listed the skill in the READMEs. Recorded the decisions in the decisions shard.
* Added the globu-status mod to the repo as mods/globu-status with a marketplace entry, npm run verify:mod in the pre-commit hook and CI, and [globu-status mod](./globu-status.md) for what it shows and how it scores. Updated [architecture](./architecture.md), [development](./development.md) and the README.
* Removed the section on what was checked from [unattended runs](./unattended-runs.md); the [hook contract](./claude-code-hooks.md) carries the test status.
* Added `globu import` for team manifests, https clones with `GLOBU_GIT_TOKEN`, the temp-directory fallback for `GLOBU_HOME` and the [unattended runs](./unattended-runs.md) guide with a GitHub Actions example. Updated [globu CLI](./globu-cli.md), [architecture](./architecture.md), the register skill and the [hook contract](./claude-code-hooks.md), which now records that the guard's deny was tested in a `claude -p` run. Recorded the decisions in the decisions shard.
* Split the docs for the public repo: moved design decisions and the globu-status mod doc to a separate private knowledge base, dropped the not-built-yet list, and added [overview](./overview.md) with the problems Globu solves and a worked example. Older log entries that linked to the moved docs now name them in plain text.
* Added the globu-status mod: the session indicator for pending knowledge updates, the skill and command names it keys on and what writing it taught about the Claude Code mod API and its test kit. Noted in [development](./development.md) how to dry-run the pin script and that commander wraps long descriptions, and opened the question of moving the mod into this repo in decisions.
* Folded the knowledge-base CLI into globu as the base group (setup, validate, list, owner, log) with the edit hook as globu hook validate-edit, so @mercastra/globu is the only npm package and globu the only command. cli-common moved into globu-cli. Updated [knowledge bases](./knowledge-base.md), [globu CLI](./globu-cli.md), [architecture](./architecture.md), [development](./development.md) and the READMEs, and recorded the decision in decisions.
* Merged the knowledge-base plugin into the globu plugin: one plugin pins both CLIs, carries the session, guard and edit hooks and the skills setup-knowledge-base, register-knowledge-base and update-knowledge. update-knowledge replaces save-knowledge and the old knowledge-base update-knowledge with one routing workflow. Renamed [knowledge-base plugin](./knowledge-base.md) to knowledge bases, updated [architecture](./architecture.md), [development](./development.md) and the README and recorded the merge and the skill naming in decisions.

## 2026-10-05
* Added [Claude Code hook contract](./claude-code-hooks.md): the hook behaviours the session and guard hooks rely on, their sources and the two that are untested.
* Released 0.2.0. Added what the release taught to [development](./development.md): bump with `npm version`, a published version cannot be released again, how to trigger and watch the workflow from the terminal and the pin commit to pull afterwards. Also noted that a git worktree needs its own install.
* Recorded in decisions that `setup` does not migrate what earlier tools wrote, and added the lessons for a future CI workflow to its open question.
* Noted in [architecture](./architecture.md) when shard matching needs a git process and that roots stay pinned from the main checkout in a worktree session.
* `setup` now inserts the authoring guide after the whole intro paragraph and never takes a heading, list, table or comment for the intro. It used to split a hard-wrapped intro after its first line. Noted the placement rule in [knowledge-base plugin](./knowledge-base.md).
* The guard now also runs before `Bash` and reads the command: redirects and file commands are certain writes, other commands possible ones, and commands that only read pass. Added the rules and their limits to [architecture](./architecture.md), updated [globu CLI](./globu-cli.md) and recorded the reasons in decisions.
* Shards are now matched by git repo, not by path prefix. A session in any linked worktree gets that worktree in the index, in `list` and in the guard, and `register` always records the main checkout. Added the session view to [architecture](./architecture.md), updated [globu CLI](./globu-cli.md) and recorded the reasons in decisions.
* Added the local mode `ask`: the guard returns the PreToolUse decision `ask` for edits from sessions in other repos and stays silent for the shard's own sessions. Updated [architecture](./architecture.md), [globu CLI](./globu-cli.md) and decisions.
* The knowledge-base scan no longer searches nested repos or worktrees when it walks without git, and `owner` stops at the root of the repo or worktree. Updated [knowledge-base plugin](./knowledge-base.md).
* Added the cloud session and teammate discovery use case to the open question on importing manifests in decisions.

## 2026-10-04
* Chose the MIT licence and recorded it in decisions. Development and CI moved to Node 26.
* The release workflow now waits until the published tarballs can be downloaded before it commits the pin and moves stable. Updated [development](./development.md).
* Removed the roadmap doc and the status note in the README. Older log entries keep the word but no longer link to it.
* Raised the runtime floor of the bundled CLIs from Node 20 to Node 22 and moved to commander 15. Updated [development](./development.md).
* Split the cli package into globu-cli and knowledge-base-cli with a shared cli-common, and renamed okf to knowledge-base and core to globu-core. Updated [architecture](./architecture.md), decisions and [development](./development.md).
* Moved both CLIs to commander. Help text is generated, usage errors come from commander and bare `globu context` no longer defaults to `list`. Updated [globu CLI](./globu-cli.md), [knowledge-base plugin](./knowledge-base.md) and [development](./development.md).
* Stopped committing the CLI bundles. The CLIs are published to npm, each plugin pins its CLI through a lockfile written by `npm run pin` and the marketplace installs plugins from the `stable` branch. Added the distribution section to [architecture](./architecture.md), the release steps to [development](./development.md) and the reasons to decisions.

## 2026-10-02
* Renamed the standalone plugin from okf-base to knowledge-base: plugin directory, CLI, skills, hook, authoring guide markers and [knowledge-base plugin](./knowledge-base.md). Replaced the index frontmatter key bootstrapped_by with knowledge_base_version. Recorded both in decisions.
* Tests now drop every GIT_* environment variable, so running them from a git hook in a worktree cannot touch the real repository. Noted in [development](./development.md).
* Removed the comment check script. Comments are now a convention: none by default, only critical ones allowed. Updated [development](./development.md), decisions, [architecture](./architecture.md) and roadmap.
* Renamed the manifest key `use_when` to `useWhen`.
* Added [development](./development.md): tooling, quality gates, tests and CI. Updated [architecture](./architecture.md), decisions and roadmap for the move to TypeScript and the simpler driver interface.
* Created this base with `knowledge-base setup`.
* Added [architecture](./architecture.md), [knowledge-base plugin](./knowledge-base.md), [globu CLI](./globu-cli.md), design decisions and roadmap alongside the first implementation of both products.
