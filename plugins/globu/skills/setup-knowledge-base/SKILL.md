description: Bootstrap or upgrade an OKF knowledge base (a docs/ directory) in a repo or in one module of a repo. Use when the user asks to set up, initialize or upgrade a knowledge base, or to add a docs/ base to a package. Idempotent, safe to re-run.

# Set up an OKF base

An OKF base is a `docs/` directory with an `index.md` that carries `okf_version`, a `log.md` and concept docs. A repo can hold several bases, for example one at the root and one per package. Nothing links them together: they are found by scanning, and knowledge about a piece of code belongs in the nearest base walking up from that code.

## Command

The CLI is installed with this plugin at `node_modules/@mercastra/globu/dist/globu.mjs` in the plugin root (two directories above this file).

```bash
node <plugin-root>/node_modules/@mercastra/globu/dist/globu.mjs base setup [target] [--name <name>] [--description "<one sentence>"]
```

- `target` defaults to the current directory. Pass the directory that should contain `docs/`, or a `docs/` path itself.
- `--name` defaults to the name of the directory holding `docs/`.
- `--description` is one sentence saying what this base covers. Other tools use it to decide when to read the base, so always supply one for a new base.

The command creates `index.md` and `log.md` when they are missing. On an existing base it only fills in required frontmatter and refreshes the authoring guide block between its markers. It never touches other content.

## Your job

1. If it is unclear which directory should hold the base (repo root or a specific package), ask the user. Otherwise proceed.
2. For a new base, draft the description from what the directory contains and pass it with `--description`.
3. Run the command and report what was created, updated or left unchanged.
4. If validation fails, show the errors and fix the files directly.
5. Do not commit unless the user asks.
